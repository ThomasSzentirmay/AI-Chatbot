# AI-Chatbot

## Description

This project is built on the OpenAI API, offered by open AI. The API allows you to use it's very advanced machine learning language models, and encorporate them inside your own projects, just like this.

This is a completely back-end application, with the chat engine running in the terminal. I would love to build the front-end one day soon, and possibly go for a ChatGPT clone project, since the model I used in the backend is the 'gpt-3.5-turbo'.

## Usage

Anyone is more than welcome to clone this repo and give the AI a go for yourselves. Head to https://platform.openai.com/ to get your own OpenAI API Key, and run 'npm intall' in the terminal of the cloned project to get all the dependancies needed for it to run.

If you are just running the application locally, you can put your API Key directly into you script.js file without needing to worry of it being blocked.
