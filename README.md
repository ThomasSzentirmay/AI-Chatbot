# Node-AI-Chatbot

## Description

This project is built on the OpenAI API, offered by open AI. The API allows you to use it's advanced machine learning language models, and encorporate them inside your own projects, just like I have here.

This is a completely back-end application, with the chat engine running inside the terminal. I would love to build the front-end one day soon, and possibly create for an entire ChatGPT clone of some sort, since the model I used in the backend is the 'gpt-3.5-turbo'.

## Usage

Everyone is more than welcome to clone this repo and give the AI a go for yourselves. Head to https://platform.openai.com/ to get your own OpenAI API Key, and run 'npm intall' in the terminal of the cloned project to get all the dependancies needed for it to run (make sure you have NodeJS installed on your machine).

If you are just running the application locally, you can put your API Key directly into you script.js file without needing to worry of it being blocked.

- Build a front-end for the application
