# ChatGPT-Clone

## Description

This project is built on the OpenAI API, offered by open AI. The API allows you to use it's advanced machine learning language models, and encorporate them inside your own projects, just like I have here.

This project has both a front-end and a back-end, and uses Express.JS to create routes for users to access the site via local host. The 'Chat 1', 'Chat 2' and 'Chat 3' buttons, along with the 'New Chat' buttons are there for looks and to resemble the real ChatGPT, but maybe one day I will add functionality for them. As if right now, I am having to have this project up and running as it is!

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, openai API, and Git.

Deployed link (You are more than welcome to test it out but please don't drain the API calls!): https://openai-clone-aba1d34bf9c0.herokuapp.com/

## Usage

Everyone is more than welcome to clone this repo and give the application a go for yourselves. Head to https://platform.openai.com/ to get your own OpenAI API Key, and run 'npm intall' in the terminal of the cloned project to get all the dependancies needed for it to run (make sure you have NodeJS installed on your machine).

If you are just running the application locally, you can put your API Key directly into you script.js file without needing to worry of it being blocked. Then run 'node server.mjs' in the project terminal, and head to localhost:3333 in your browser!
